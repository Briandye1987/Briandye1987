About GitHub Copilot and JetBrains IDEs
This guide demonstrates how to get coding suggestions from GitHub Copilot in a JetBrains IDE. To see instructions for other popular coding environments, use the tool switcher at the top of the page.

The examples in this guide use Java, however other languages will work similarly. GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++. GitHub Copilot can also assist in query generation for databases, generating suggestions for APIs and frameworks, and can help with infrastructure as code development.

Prerequisites
Access to Copilot. To use GitHub Copilot in JetBrains, you need either an active Copilot subscription (such as Copilot Pro, Copilot Enterprise, or Copilot Business) or access through Copilot Free, which provides limited functionality. For information about how to get access to Copilot, see What is GitHub Copilot?.

Getting code suggestions
GitHub Copilot offers coding suggestions as you type. For example, in a Java file, create a class by typing class Test.

GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest a class body in grayed text. To accept the suggestion, press Tab.

You can also describe something you want to do using natural language within a comment, and Copilot will suggest the code to accomplish your goal. For example, type this comment in a Java file:

Java
// find all images without alternate text
// and give them a red border
void process () {
GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest code. To accept the suggestion, press Tab.

GitHub Copilot will attempt to match the context and style of your code. You can always edit the suggested code.

Tip

If you receive limited or no suggestions from Copilot, you may have duplication detection enabled. For more information about duplication detection, see Managing Copilot policies as an individual subscriber.

Showing alternative suggestions
For any given input, GitHub Copilot may offer multiple suggestions. You can select which suggestion to use, or reject all suggestions.

For example, type the following line in a Java file, and press Enter:

Java
private int calculateDaysBetweenDates(Date date1,
GitHub Copilot will show you a suggestion.

Now hover over the suggestion to show the GitHub Copilot control for choosing suggestions. To display next or previous suggestions, click the forward or back arrow button in the control.

You can also use keyboard shortcuts to show alternative suggestions:

OS	See next suggestion	See previous suggestion
macOS	Option+]	Option+[
Windows or Linux	Alt+]	Alt+[
To accept a suggestion, click "Accept" in the Copilot command palette, or press Tab. To reject all suggestions, press Esc.

Showing multiple suggestions in a new tab
If you don't want to use any of the initial suggestions GitHub Copilot offers, you can show multiple suggestions in a new tab.

For example, type the following line in a Java file:

Java
private int calculateDaysBetweenDates(Date date1,
GitHub Copilot will show you a suggestion.

To open a new tab with multiple additional suggestions, use the following keyboard shortcut, then click Open GitHub Copilot:

OS	Open multiple suggestions
macOS	Command+Shift+A
Windows or Linux	Ctrl+Enter
To accept a suggestion, below the suggestion, click Accept suggestion NUMBER. To reject all suggestions, close the tab.

Accepting partial suggestions
If you don't want to accept an entire suggestion from GitHub Copilot, you can accept the next word or the next line of a suggestion.

For example, type the following line in a Java file:

Java
private int calculateDaysBetweenDates(Date date1,
GitHub Copilot will show a suggestion in grayed text. The exact suggestion may vary.

Now hover over the suggestion to show the GitHub Copilot control for choosing suggestions. To accept only the next word of the suggestion, click Accept Word in the control.

Alternatively, you can use a keyboard shortcut to accept the next word of a suggestion:

OS	Accept Next Word	Accept Next Line
macOS	Command+‚Üí	Command+Control+‚Üí
Windows or Linux	Control+‚Üí	Control+Alt+‚Üí
If you want to accept the next line of a suggestion, you will need to set a custom keyboard shortcut for the command editor.action.inlineSuggest.acceptNextLine. For more information on setting custom keyboard shortcuts, see Configuring GitHub Copilot in your environment.
